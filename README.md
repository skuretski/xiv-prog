# XIV Prog Discord Bot

## What it is?
Based on your guild/static/team's FFLogs, this Discord bot will provide a progression summary. This can mean one session or it can show a progression summary over the course of multiple progression sessions. 
A great example of this would be for savage and ultimate content. FFLogs sometimes provides a mechanics snapshot of your team for one fight, but there is nothing that provides a 
summary snapshot of how you are doing over the course of time, whether that is a couple raid sessions or months of prog in an ultimate.

## Usage
TBD...

## This project is a current work in progress
Please bear with us as we dig around FFLogs API and do our data aggregation. It will take some time to get support for all fights.
